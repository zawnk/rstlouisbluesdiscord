## General Bot Info

The server has two bots that are at your service for various tasks. Both have very different tasks:

- [nhlbot](nhlbot): Serves hockey statistics about players and teams, informs you about players and the schedule and can even remind you of games. Reacts to `!` commands
- [Bot](bot): An all-purpose bot that is mainly used for random gifs and some mini-games (yes, that's its name :grinning:). Reacts to `?` commands

Both bots come with a help command (either `!help` for nhlbot or `?help` for Bot). For some details regarding the commands, check the pages for the bots or just dive into the bot help in Discord.
