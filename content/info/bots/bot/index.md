## Purpose

The bot Bot :smirk: is a general all-purpose bot and reacts to all commands starting with `?`. Its functionality is completely unrelated to hockey. The bot is a self hosted instance of [Red Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). If you ever run into issues, feel free to contact `zonk`.

## Notable Commands

#### `?wiki <term>`

This one, as you would've guessed, just looks up the word on Wikipedia and shows a brief snippet and link to the article. 

#### `?quote <user>`

The bot has a user maintained list of quotes from specific users. You can just omit the user and get a random quote, or add a user to the command get a specific user's random quote. Adding quotes is only available to moderators.

#### `?gif <term>`

With this command you can make the bot look up a gif they find on giphy and post it to the channel. When text can is just not enough to express your feelings.

#### `?gifr <term>`

Similar to the before-mentioned command, but instead of always yielding the same gif, it will take a random gif from giphy. Less consistent but more fun!

#### `?google <term>`

Pastes a link to the Google search with the term that you can click (you lazy bum).

#### `?remindme X (seconds|minutes|days) <text>`
The bot will remember what you told him with your text and will remind you in the given period of time of what you told him. An example is: `?remindme 5 minutes tea done`
