## Purpose

The bot Bot :smirk: is an ancient general all-purpose bot and reacts to all commands starting with `?`. Its functionality is completely unrelated to hockey. The bot is a self hosted instance of [Red Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). If you ever run into issues, feel free to contact `zonk`.

## Notable Commands

#### `?help`

The most important command comes first: with `?help` the bot sends you all commands that are available with a short description via pm. Everything that you can read there will also be included in the help but with less details and without examples.

#### `?wiki <term>`

This one, as you would've guessed, just looks up the word on Wikipedia and shows a brief snippet and link to the article. 

#### `?quote <user>`

The bot has a user maintained list of quotes from specific users. You can just omit the user and get a random quote, or add a user to the command get a specific user's random quote. Adding quotes is only available to moderators.

#### `?gif <term>`

With this command you can make the bot look up a gif they find on giphy and post it to the channel. When text can is just not enough to express your feelings.

#### `?gifr <term>`

Similar to the before-mentioned command, but instead of always yielding the same gif, it will take a random gif from giphy. Less consistent but more fun!

#### `?google <term>`

Pastes a link to the Google search with the term that you can click (you lazy bum).

#### `?remindme X (seconds|minutes|days) <text>`

The bot will remember what you told him with your text and will remind you in the given period of time of what you told him. An example is: `?remindme 5 minutes tea done`

#### `?role (apply|relieve) <role name>`

For specific occasions, the moderators add temporary, cosmetic roles that are pingable. This is generally helpful when you're organizing events like the fantasy leagues. The moderators then create a group for a fantasy league, so it's easy to contact the peers with due to the assigned roles. You can freely assign yourself such a role with `?role apply <role name>` or get rid of it via `?role relieve <role name>`. When such roles with specific purposes are created, the mods announce it in the appropriate channel.

## Ideas and Feedback

If you have any suggestions for improving or extending the bot, feel free to contact `zonk` with your ideas! Same goes for issues with the bot.
