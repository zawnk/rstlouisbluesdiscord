## Server Roles

As you may have noticed, certain users have a yellow or blue user name. Users with a colored name belong to either of these two groups:

- <font color="#F1C40F">Discord mods</font>: These users are your first priority when you have questions or suggestions for the Discord server. They are in control of the server and can mute people, delete their messages or even ban people

- <font color="#3498DB">Reddit mods</font>: Some of the [subreddit's moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/stlouisblues/about/moderators) are also active on the Discord. In general it's easier to contact them on reddit or via modmail, but if you see one hanging around, you might contact them with questions about the subreddit or similar.
