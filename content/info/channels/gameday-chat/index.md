## Usage

The gameday chat is for discussion about the regular Blues games. It mainly serves two purposes:

Information that's related to the soon-ish upcoming game is shared in there. If a player is a game-time decision, it's shared in there. Tonight's lines are generally shared in there. Infos about the upcoming opponents are shared in there. If you want to be up to speed for the upcoming game, just hang around in here. 

The second - and more important - role of this channel is the live discussion during the game. A lot of users will hang in there while they're watching the game and chat about it. Please be aware that some users might be ahead of you for up to two minutes, so they might spoil the game events if you're far behind them. If that's the case, it's smart to just check the game at stoppages. 

Since not all users on the server can watch all games live, it is **mandatory** that **all results and live talk** about the game are contained in this channel. As a rule of thumb, stick to this rule at least till the next morning to give everyone a chance to catch up. Talking about the results of the on-going or just finished games outside of this channel is heavily frowned upon, ruins the VOD of the game for others and is [punishable](../../rules#channel-specific-rules).
