## Discord Channels

The amount of Discord channels is changing quite regularly and we are re-evaluating which channels make sense and which are obsolete at all times. They all serve a specific purpose and should be used for that if possible.

We're trying to keep the number of channels limited, since we'd rather have a few active channels than a lot of channels of which half are barely used and people need to start hiding channels that they're not interested in. 

If you think a new channel for a specific purpose is necessary, feel free to suggest it to the Discord Mods and we can discuss it.

The current list of channels and their main purposes are as follows (click them for more details):

- [**#general**](../channels/general): As the name suggests, in here you can talk about any kind of hockey news, rumors, but also any other kind of off-topic chit chat
- [**#gameday-chat**](../channels/gameday-chat): This is the main gathering point when there's a Blues game upcoming or on-going. All match-related spoilers go in here for the remainder of the night
- [**#other-sports**](../channels/other-sports): Since St. Louis is a town full of sports fanatics, we also discuss the Cardinals, the AHL, the NFL, MLS or any other sports in here
- [**#gaming**](../channels/gaming): Any gaming related news go in here. If you're looking for people to party up with, this is the place to go
- [**#media**](../channels/media): In here you can discuss your favorite movies, series or music. Make sure to use spoiler tags if you're talking about unaired material
- [**#fantasysports**](../channels/fantasysports): We also organize fantasy leagues of all kinds (NHL, MLB, NFL). Veterans as well as newbies are welcome! :blush:
- [**#spam**](../channels/spam): Here you can spam (within reason) bot commands and images to your heart's delight if you don't want to disturb others
- [**#trade-and-draft**](../channels/trade-and-draft): If the trade rumors and deadline or the drafts are your favourite time of the season, this is your channel

Also, make sure to occasionally check the channel specific pins (push pin icon at the top of Discord). Updated or temporary channel rules and other information is generally pinned there.

Please keep the [channel specific rules](../rules/#channel-specific-rules) in mind.
