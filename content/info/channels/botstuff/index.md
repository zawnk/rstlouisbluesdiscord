## Usage

There's not too much to say about this channel. In here you can spam the [bots'](../../bots) commands to your delight. There are some mini games that are a bit spammy, so that's a good use case for this channel. It also gives you a way to check the stats for a couple of things one after another without ruining an on-going discussion in another channel. Please be respectful and just use this channel in this case.
