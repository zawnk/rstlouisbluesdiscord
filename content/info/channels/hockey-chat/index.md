## Usage

The name of this channel is very broad for this exact reason: in here you can talk about anything related to hockey. No matter what league or what team, everything is welcome here. Share an interesting tweet or article about hockey or its events in this channel.

Please be aware that non-hockey related discussions are to be avoided in here (see [#general](../channels/general)).
