## Usage

The internet is full of fantastic media that deserves to be shared. In here you can discuss your favourite series, movies, music and more. If you're following on-going series, please use this channel to discuss the episode/movie. This way other fans that can't watch it yet can still freely use the server by just avoiding this particular channel until they've seen it.

#### Avoiding Spoilers

If you want to discuss leaked information of unaired movies or series, spoiler tags are **mandatory**. Spoilers might ruin the excitement for other people, so make sure it is not possible for people to be accidentally spoiled.

Best practice for spoilers is the following:

`topic of the spoiler ||actually hidden content||`

The hidden content is blacked out in Discord and users have to actively click it to make it visible. By providing some (non spoiler) context *in front* of the spoilers, users definitely know whether they can click the spoiler or not. One example:

`this one star wars movie plot ||guys, vader is totally luke's dad!!||`

If in doubt, use spoilers.
