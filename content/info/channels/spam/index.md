## Usage

There's not too much to say about this channel. In here you can spam the [bots'](../../bots) commands to your delight. There are some mini games that are a bit spammy, so thatâ€™s a good use case for this channel. It also gives you a way to check the stats for a couple of things one after another without ruining an on-going discussion in another channel. 

In addition to that, if you're having a longer off-topic conversation or engaging in some good ole banter with other users you should use this channel. Please be respectful and just use this channel in this case.

This is also the only channel in which you can share your memes and other images as it is the only channel that allows file attachments. 

**Important note**: Even though the channel is marked as NSFW, no actual content that is against the [../../rules/#dont-be-a-jerk](Golden Rule) can be shared in here. This includes but is not limited to 18+, sexist, political or racist content. Failure to follow this simple rule will result in [a ban](../../rules/#consequences).
