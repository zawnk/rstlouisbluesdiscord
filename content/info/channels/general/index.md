## Usage

The channel name gives it all away, this is just a catch-all channel, mainly for any hockey talk. Off-topic discussions are okay, but please make sure to not spam (see [#spam](../channels/spam)). Also, be aware that this is at its core still a hockey server, so if there’s a lively discussion going on about hockey, what you ate for lunch yesterday might not be important to other people right now. Don’t force this info upon them.

In addition, make sure to check the channel pins occasionally, new infos and updates are generally shared and pinned in this channel.
