## Usage

Some members of the Discord regularly organize fantasy leagues for all the different sports. We're running multiple NHL leagues and also generally have a MLB as well as a NFL league. 

If you'd like to join an upcoming league, just keep an eye on the channel. There will be signup forms where you can enter if you're interested and give feedback on the mode and league settings. 

One requirement, though: If you join a league, make sure you stick with it! Nothing is more frustrating than a 16 man league that's half inactive after half of the season. Not only ruins it the fun, but it also invalidates the standings. Be aware, that you're committing for a whole season. If you're unsure how much effort it is to maintain a league, just ask in the channel, there are plenty of experienced fantasy players around.
