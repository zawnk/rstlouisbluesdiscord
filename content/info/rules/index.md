## General Rules <a name="general-rules"></a>

The rules can be divided into two major parts: One is a single server-wide rule, and then there are minor rules, that are more specific to single channels. Latter will be mentioned here to have an overview, but will be explained in detail in the specific [channel's page](../channels) here in the docs.

### Don't be a jerk <a name="dont-be-a-jerk"></a>

The only rule that you have to follow on the Blues Discord channel is the so called [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule):

>The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated.
>
> * One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).
> * One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form).
> * What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathic or responsive form).

In layman's terms this means: don't be a jerk. You should not be a jerk on the server. Neither to (a) specific (group of) people on the server, nor to other hockey fans on their respective Discord. We have a zero tolerance rule for the latter and if you get banned on any teams' server, you will also get banned on our server.  
If you're wondering and asking yourself if you're being a jerk in a specific situation, you're most likely being a jerk and should take a walk outside.

### Examples <a name="examples"></a>

In case you're not aware what it means to be a jerk or not, here are some things you should **not** do (the list is not exhaustive):

- Don't be racist
- Don't blindly hate other teams' fans
- Don't spam on the server or directly to a person
- Use the appropriate [channels](../channels) for the appropriate topics
- Don't spoil the results for others

### Channel specific rules <a name="channel-specific-rules"></a>

Here's a list of additional rules which are linked to specific channels on the server. They have to be followed as well:

- All discussion about an on-going Blues game are to be contained in [#gameday-chat](../channels/gameday-chat). The server has to be usable by users who're not able to watch the games live **until the next day** (And that means when you get up, not one minute after midnight. Remember: [don't be a jerk](#dont-be-a-jerk))

- The server's [bot](../bot) has several fun functions that can be spammed. Please take the time and execute those commands in [#spam](../channels/spam)

- The [#media](../channels/media) channel is there to discuss on-going and upcoming movies and series. This means, spoilers also belong there. If you're talking about already aired stuff, no spoilers are necessary. If material is leaked of *upcoming* movies/series, spoiler tags are **mandatory** (you can do them with double pipes, e.g. `||here goes the hidden text||`)

## Consequences <a name="consequences"></a>

The degree of punishment is completely subject to the moderator's opinion and warnings are not required to be banned (dictatorship :fearful:). Generally, we let you know when you're crossing the line, but it is *not guaranteed*. If you start spamming racial slurs, don't expect a gentle warning, you'll be banned.

There's also a `muted` role, which will prevent you from participating in the chat in any way, other than being able to read it. If the mods are having a good day, you might be muted instead of banned.

If you're convinced that you're being treated unfairly, feel free to contact a second moderator, so he can bring it up for discussion in the moderator chat for discussion and reevaluation. But don't expect bans to be overturned.
